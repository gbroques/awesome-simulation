## Motivation
With simulation, we can study[<sup>1</sup>][1]:

* systems that do not exist (yet)
* systems that do exist, but without interrupting the course of operations
* different layout versions with very low effort
* system behavior over a long period of time.

## Basics
Simulation is experimentation with a model. A **model** is an entity that is used to represent some other entity for some defined purpose. In general,
models are simplified abstractions, which embrace only the scope and level of detail needed to satisfy
specific study objectives[<sup>2</sup>][2].

There are two basic kinds of simulation[<sup>1</sup>][1]:
* **event-driven simulation** - change of state within the simulation model occurs after an incidence of an event.
* **time-driven simulation** - change of state occurs after fixed time slices.

## Books
* [Modeling and Simulation in Python](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy) - introduction to physical modeling using a computational approach.
